# NumberSearch
A class was developed with the C++ programming language that finds how to calculate an integer specified as the target with 6 other integers, and four operations (using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Input should be like: std::string = “2 3 7 10 25 50”
Output will be string too.
